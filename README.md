TwittStorm for Geosoftware II
## Weblinks
The code of this project can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/PaulaScharf/Geosoftware2-TwittStorm](https://github.com/PaulaScharf/Geosoftware2-TwittStorm)
## Routes
Are in the routes folder in the index.js. The crud functionality is provided through the database.js in the same folder.
## Pages
The Webpages are in the views folder and are in the .ejs format which can be used just like HTML.
## CRUD
The CRUD functionality is based on the solution for Geosoft1 and still uses the format that was used for that task. Can be changed once we know what we need to use it for.
